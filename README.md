# BiAn
BiAn is a tool developed for Ethereum smart contracts that impedes symbolic execution. It is used to branch obfuscation. The members participating in this project are @xf97, ZhangMeng.

# Idea
We will use two techniques, *opaque predicate* and *hidden branch condition*, to obfuscate the smart contract bytecode, so as to achieve the purpose of resisting symbol execution. We want to increase the difficulty of symbol execution, thereby promoting the development of symbol execution tools for smart contracts, or providing more difficult test cases.
